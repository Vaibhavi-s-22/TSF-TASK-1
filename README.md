# TSF-TASK-1
Task 1 -TSF - Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

Problem Statement :
There is a given Dataset of Percentage Score & number of Hours Studied by a Student.
We have to predict the Percentage of a student based upon their number of Hours Studied.
Inthis case, 9.26 hours.

The code contains the data location,loading and preprocessing parts.
Then we train the model on our dataset.
Finally, we predict the required solution.
We also Check the suitability of the model using Mean Square Error Method.
